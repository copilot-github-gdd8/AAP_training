Strategies are useful when:
- Some hosts take longer to complete task
- You need parallelism and efficiency
- You want to control error-handling approach when working across devices

- Linear - Run tasks on all hosts sequentially
- Free - Allows hosts to run task independently
- Debug - Pauses on error for interactive debugging

There is a limitation of Diff and check_mode module: 
can only combine check with diff using the diff_against options of 
  - startup
  - intended
but not running.

Best Practices are to use the diff and check_mode to safely run the playbook.
